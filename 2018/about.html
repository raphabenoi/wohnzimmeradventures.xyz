			<h2 class="separators"><span class="yellow">WHAT are we talking about.</span></h2>
			<p>	December. Time to hide you might say – summer tan’s gone and who is that Sun they always talk about anyways?
					For many, the advent of Christ is about restoring depleted energy levels.
					Some turn to coffee, others exchange their favourite Pokémons.
					But nothing is as powerful in combatting midwinter’s depression than friends.
					Friends to chat with, to cuddle, to make tea for, to play games with, to undress, to argue with, to love.
					That’s why we propose to expand the horizons of pre-Christmas advents in a week-long session of <span class="yellow">adventures of friendship</span>.
					Instead of a ship, we offer you our Wohnzimmer = living room(s).
				  </p>

			<h2 class="separators"><span class="blue">WHEN you wonder?.</span></h2>
			<p>	Starting on Thursday <span class="blue">13th</span>, ending on Wednesday <span class="blue">19th of December</span> 2018.
			    </p>

			<h2 class="separators"><span class="orange">WTF are we going to do?.</span></h2>
			<p>	Apart from going WILD and connecting with each other, there will be <span class="orange">activities</span>
					ranging from concerts to silent meditation, from playing ice hockey to workshops
					about robots and the ocean, from group sauna to introductions to coffee-making.
					Please refer to the scheduling planet.
				  </p>

			<h2 class="separators"><span class="green">$$$.</span></h2>
		  <p>	As per the cash question: it will be necessary to cover some expenses.
				  Our basement human PC has done the math: everyone needs to contribute
					<span class="green">10 €</span>
					With this we will provide some food and drinks to enable your take-off every night.
					</p>

		  <h2 class="separators"><span class="magenta">Take-off.</span></h2>
			<p>	We are quite confident that there will be enough sleeping space for all fellow adventurers in Berlin Wohnzimmers. So: 
					Friends, amies et amis, Freundinnen und Freunde, we eagerly await you! Bring your humble awesomeness.
