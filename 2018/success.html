			<p id="bueys">You have hit us in the heart. The entire team of
			Wohnzimmeradventures is struck by your electronic lightning and
			reverberating with emotional electrons, positive albeit negative.
			You will soon receive our ephemeral answer out of space when it
			has transcended from our brains through the copper and glass fibre
			networks and been virus-checked by two mail servers in North Dakota
			where reindeer roam on an adjacent farm because it is cold and electrons
			like it cold around the nose and warm around the heart. So do we. Jabbering
			for you perhaps, but to the team of Wohnzimmeradventures it is a way of
			expressing our hope that you will hang on until we get back to you which
			might take longer than reading this poem. <br>Getting back to you soon.</p>
