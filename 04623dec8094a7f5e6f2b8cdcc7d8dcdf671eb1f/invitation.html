			This website will auto-destruct after Sunday November 18th.<br>
			Make sure you've made it <span class="magenta">to the bottom</span> by then!!

			<h2 class="separators"><span class="yellow">WHAT are we talking about.</span></h2>
			<p>	December. Time to hide you might say – summer tan’s gone and who is that Sun they always talk about anyways?
					For many, the advent of Christ is about restoring depleted energy levels.
					Some turn to coffee, others exchange their favourite Pokémons.
					But nothing is as powerful in combatting midwinter’s depression than friends.
					Friends to chat with, to cuddle, to make tea for, to play games with, to undress, to argue with, to love.
					That’s why we propose to expand the horizons of pre-Christmas advents in a week-long session of <span class="yellow">adventures of friendship</span>.
					Instead of a ship, we offer you our Wohnzimmer = living room(s). </p>

			<h2 class="separators"><span class="blue">WHEN you wonder?.</span></h2>
			<p>	Starting on Thursday <span class="blue">13th</span>, ending on Wednesday <span class="blue">19th of December</span> 2018.	</p>

			<h2 class="separators"><span class="orange">WTF are we going to do?.</span></h2>
			<p>	Apart from going WILD and connecting with each other, there will be <span class="orange">activities</span> ranging from concerts to silent meditation, from playing ice hockey to workshops
					about robots and the ocean, from group sauna to introductions to coffee-making.
					We have ideas, but we need you to turn them into reality <span class="orange">&#9656; see below!</span> Once you confirm you’re coming,
					we’ll send you a list of activities to choose from and will then build your custom timetable. </p>

			<p>	Here are some <span class="orange">activities</span> which <span class="orange">we will host ourselves</span>:<br>
					- Group yoga<br>
					- Group sauna<br>
					- Music-listening only concert (no talking)<br>
			    - Tattooworkshop<br>
				  - Empowerment through Reggaeton<br>
					- Building bridges (of all kinds)<br>
					- Workshop of making animal sounds<br>
					- Knitting socks<br>
					- On the possibilites of condoms<br>
					- How to buy a car in different languages<br>
					- Mind to muscle<br>
					- Endless screening of great childhood heroes movies<br>
				  </p>

			<p>	If <span class="orange">you</span> wish to <span class="orange">propose an activity (next page)</span>, we would be happy and honoured
					> drop the suggestion like it’s cold as Christmas in our email inbox. Some things to keep in mind: <br>
					- Activities can be inside or outside<br>
					- You will be responsible for your activity<br>
					- Activities can take between 15 minutes and a day or a night<br>
					-Activies can range from performances, to workshops and hangouts<br>
					- Friends who confirmed they’re coming will choose activities so you can be sure you’re not activing alone<br>
					- For all the rest, we will get in touch with you! (see next page)<br>
				  </p>

			<p>	Ideas of <span class="orange">activities</span> that are desperately <span class="orange">looking for someone to host them</span>:<br>

					</p>

					<h2 class="separators"><span class="green">$$$.</span></h2>
					<p>	As per the cash question: it will be necessary to cover some expenses.
							As soon as we know who is coming, we will do the math to figure out <span class="green">how small we need your contribution to be</span>.
							Some food and drinks will be taken care of. We will try our best to provide spots to sleep for everyone. </p>
